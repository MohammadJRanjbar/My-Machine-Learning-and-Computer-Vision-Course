# Project:
The project is about implementing lane detection using OpenCV and controlling the car with them.
We use Avis engine [Avis engine](https://avisengine.com/) Which was designed by a team in AmirKabir university 
This is a result of one of my [students](https://github.com/adib-vali) for code and more you can check his github.
